# Introduction
Introducing: The FuncFactory! Easily adaptable production grade code on the fly.

There is a famous rule in the field of programming: 80-20. 80% of the code is written in the first 20% of the time. The last 20% of the code is written in the final 80% of the time.
The FuncFactory aims to help reduce this last 80% by providing all the often repetative "scafolding" one makes in this last 80%. Think of: Error handeling, result creation, configuring functions.

The only thing the user has to define/create is a set of functions and the inputs of these functions in a seperate config file and the FuncFactory takes care of the rest!

The FuncFactory loads both, folds them and starts creating the Fun(K)! Separating the function definition and execution 
has as benefit that one can very easily and confidently change the function input without doubting if the code (running in production).
might break. One can easily string together functions to make complete workflows/pipelines which are
- Easily modifiable
- Easily Adaptable
- Easily Configurable
- Just Quick and Easy..
