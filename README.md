Introducing: The FuncFactory! Easily adaptable production grade code on the fly.

Python Functions are awesome! And the FuncFactory facilitates the creation of production grade code from mere
functions! Users simply define a set of function and configure the function inputs in a separate config file.
The FuncFactory loads both, folds them and starts creating the Fun! Separating the function definition and execution 
has as benefit that one can very easily and confidently change the function input without doubting if the code (running in production).
might break. One can easily string together functions to make complete workflows/pipelines which are
- Easily modifiable
- Easily Adaptable
